# SGS01 BTHome  ![](wiki/cloudfree-64x32.jpg)
Custom firmware for the Tuya SGS01 soil sensor to send data in standard BTHome format.

Project status:	23.08.2025 started alpha test with 4 devices


## Sensor

 ![](wiki/sgs01.jpg)

 Model: SGS01 / HZ-SL05 / "Connected Home PLANT MONITOR" / PID gvygg3m8
 Manufacturer: Shenzhen HaiHao Electronic Co.LTD
 Firmware: Tuya Cloud Protocol


##  Custom Firmware Features

- Bluetooth Low Energy
- Advertising sensor data in BTHome V2 format
- BTHome V2 data encryption supported
- Alternative data formats: BTHome V1, Xiaomi
- BLE GATT profile to configure and secure the sensor
- Supporting OTA for firmware updates
- Extended battery life time

## Description

- The sensor is a well designed "plant monitor" with water protection and two AAA batteries for long operation
- Hardware design: a TUYA BT3L bluetooth module (TLSR8250 chip, 512k flash) and a third party MCU to measure data, control button and LED
- The BT3L module communicates with the MCU over UART serial, TUYA third party MCU protocol
- The custom firmware replaces the BT3L module firmware, handles the MCU serial protocol and send the sensor data in BTHome format

## Flashing the custom firmware

Note: When flashing the custom BTHome firmware, the sensor won't work with the Tuya cloud.

- Unmount the 4 screws in the battery case and remove the back cover.

- TELINK BDT
  [BDT Tool](https://wiki.telink-semi.cn/wiki/IDE-and-Tools/Burning-and-Debugging-Tools-for-all-Series/ ""): Flashing by TELink Buring and debugging tool.
  Connect:
>   *Sensor Vcc - BDT 3V3*
    *Sensor Gnd - BDT GND*
    *Sensor SWS - BDT SWM*

  Select chip type B85 to flash.
- PVVX
  [TlsrComSwireWriter](https://github.com/pvvx/TlsrComSwireWriter ""):
  Flashing by "USB/TTL adapter" and PVVX python script.
  Connect:
>    *Sensor Vcc - TTL 3V3 (ensure 3.3V power)*
    *Sensor Gnd - TTL Gnd*
    *Sensor SWS - TTL RxTx*
    *Sensor Reset - TTL Rts*

- Note: If the sensor firmware was updated by OTA, erase flash range 0x00000 - 0x3FFFF. DO NOT erase flash above 0x70000, here is the manufactor pre-programmed area (MAC address and chip calibration data).    
- May read out the original firmware (first 128k bytes) before flashing.
- Firmware files are located in the subdirectory **/fw**.
- Flash the xxx.bin at start address 0x00000.    

## Getting Started    

- No time? Just flash the module and insert batteries. The sensor will start up in connection mode (LED flashing) and changes after 60 seconds to measure mode - advertising BTHome data.   
- For configuration and encryption have a look at the manual. [```PDF```](wiki/SGS01-BTHome-Manual.pdf)    

## TODO's    

- Check long time battery usage
